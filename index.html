    <h1>Privacy Policy for RoboPilot</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> October 2024</p>

    <p>
        This privacy policy describes how your information is handled when you use the RoboPilot application (the "App").
    </p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>
        The App is designed to be simple and private. We do not collect or store any personal data that you don't provide voluntarily. The information handled by the app falls into two categories:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Locally Stored Data:</strong> App settings, such as your theme preference (light/dark), are stored locally on your device using Android's DataStore. This data is never transmitted or shared.</li>
        <li><strong>Third-Party Advertising Data:</strong> The App uses Google AdMob to display advertisements. AdMob may collect and use data to provide personalized ads. This may include device information and your advertising ID. For more details on how Google handles this data, please review <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads">Google's Advertising Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Permissions Used by the App</h2>
    <p>The App requests the following permissions for specific functionalities:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>BLUETOOTH_CONNECT:</strong> This permission is essential for the core functionality of the App, which is to connect to and communicate with your Arduino or other Bluetooth-enabled hardware. The app does not collect, store, or transmit any data over Bluetooth other than the commands you send.</li>
        <li><strong>INTERNET:</strong> This permission is required by Google AdMob to download and display advertisements within the App.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>
        Your information is used solely to:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Provide the core services of the App (controlling your hardware via Bluetooth).</li>
        <li>Display advertisements through Google AdMob to support the app's development.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Sharing of Information</h2>
    <p>
        We do not share any personal information because we do not collect it. Data collected by Google AdMob is subject to their own privacy policies.
